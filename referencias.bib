abstract = {This paper introduces the development of an automated visual inspection system for printed circuit boards (PCBs). It utilizes an elimination-subtraction method which directly subtracts the template image from the inspected image, and then conducts an elimination procedure to locate defects in the PCB. Each detected defect is subsequently classified into one of the seven defect types by three indices: the type of object detected, the difference in object numbers, and the difference in background numbers between the inspected image and the template. Finally, a 256 × 240 PCB image was tested to show the effectiveness of this system.}

Machine learning (ML) refers to a system's ability to acquire, and integrate knowledge through large-scale observations, and to improve, and extend itself by learning new knowledge rather than by being programmed with that knowledge. ML techniques are used in intelligent tutors to acquire new knowledge about students, identify their skills, and learn new teaching approaches. They improve teaching by repeatedly observing how students react and generalize rules about the domain or student. The role of ML techniques in a tutor is to independently observe and evaluate the tutor's actions. ML tutors customize their teaching by reasoning about large groups of students, and tutor-student interactions, generated through several components. A performance element is responsible for making improvements in the tutor, using perceptions of tutor/student interactions, and knowledge about the student's reaction to decide how to modify the tutor to perform better in the future. ML techniques are used to identify student learning strategies, such as, which activities do students select most frequently and in which order. Analysis of student behavior leads to greater student learning outcome by providing tutors with useful diagnostic information for generating feedback.}

Cyber security machine learning based models need to be able to represent a real-world system, infer system properties, and learn and adapt based on knowledge and observations. The chapter starts with an introduction of the concepts and techniques of machine learning, outlining the categories of machine learning—classification, clustering, regression, and anomaly detection. The chapter then explores the use of probabilistic models, such as Bayesian networks and hidden Markov models, as data driven classification/modeling strategies, with examples given.}

abstract = {Smart manufacturing is critical in improving the quality of the process industry. In smart manufacturing, there is a trend to incorporate different kinds of new-generation information technologies into process-safety analysis. At present, green manufacturing is facing major obstacles related to safety management, due to the usage of large amounts of hazardous chemicals, resulting in spatial inhomogeneity of chemical industrial processes and increasingly stringent safety and environmental regulations. Emerging information technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) are quite promising as a means of overcoming these difficulties. Based on state-of-the-art AI methods and the complex safety relations in the process industry, we identify and discuss several technical challenges associated with process safety: ① knowledge acquisition with scarce labels for process safety; ② knowledge-based reasoning for process safety; ③ accurate fusion of heterogeneous data from various sources; and ④ effective learning for dynamic risk assessment and aided decision-making. Current and future works are also discussed in this context.}

abstract = {In this work, we proposed a data-driven soft sensor based on deep learning techniques, namely the convolutional neural network (CNN). In the proposed soft sensor, instead of only building time-independent correlations among the key variable with other measurements, the moving window method is utilized to describe the most recent process dynamics, where the time-dependent correlation can be located. Beyond on that, a signal recovery scheme is developed to improve the model robustness when confronting common sensor faults. The proposed soft sensoring technique was tested on the composition data of gas-phase components from an ethylene pyrolysis reactor. The model was also verified through the manually introduced sensor faults.}
