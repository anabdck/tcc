abstract = {This paper introduces the development of an automated visual inspection system for printed circuit boards (PCBs). It utilizes an elimination-subtraction method which directly subtracts the template image from the inspected image, and then conducts an elimination procedure to locate defects in the PCB. Each detected defect is subsequently classified into one of the seven defect types by three indices: the type of object detected, the difference in object numbers, and the difference in background numbers between the inspected image and the template. Finally, a 256 × 240 PCB image was tested to show the effectiveness of this system.}

Machine learning (ML) refers to a system's ability to acquire, and integrate knowledge through large-scale observations, and to improve, and extend itself by learning new knowledge rather than by being programmed with that knowledge. ML techniques are used in intelligent tutors to acquire new knowledge about students, identify their skills, and learn new teaching approaches. They improve teaching by repeatedly observing how students react and generalize rules about the domain or student. The role of ML techniques in a tutor is to independently observe and evaluate the tutor's actions. ML tutors customize their teaching by reasoning about large groups of students, and tutor-student interactions, generated through several components. A performance element is responsible for making improvements in the tutor, using perceptions of tutor/student interactions, and knowledge about the student's reaction to decide how to modify the tutor to perform better in the future. ML techniques are used to identify student learning strategies, such as, which activities do students select most frequently and in which order. Analysis of student behavior leads to greater student learning outcome by providing tutors with useful diagnostic information for generating feedback.}

abstract = {Smart manufacturing is critical in improving the quality of the process industry. In smart manufacturing, there is a trend to incorporate different kinds of new-generation information technologies into process-safety analysis. At present, green manufacturing is facing major obstacles related to safety management, due to the usage of large amounts of hazardous chemicals, resulting in spatial inhomogeneity of chemical industrial processes and increasingly stringent safety and environmental regulations. Emerging information technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) are quite promising as a means of overcoming these difficulties. Based on state-of-the-art AI methods and the complex safety relations in the process industry, we identify and discuss several technical challenges associated with process safety: ① knowledge acquisition with scarce labels for process safety; ② knowledge-based reasoning for process safety; ③ accurate fusion of heterogeneous data from various sources; and ④ effective learning for dynamic risk assessment and aided decision-making. Current and future works are also discussed in this context.}

In the proposed soft sensor, instead of only building time-independent correlations among the key variable with other measurements, the moving window method is utilized to describe the most recent process dynamics, where the time-dependent correlation can be located. Beyond on that, a signal recovery scheme is developed to improve the model robustness when confronting common sensor faults. The proposed soft sensoring technique was tested on the composition data of gas-phase components from an ethylene pyrolysis reactor. The model was also verified through the manually introduced sensor faults.}

Many times, this problem contributes to bias while making decisions or implementing policies. Thus, it is vital to understand the factors which cause imbalance in the data (or class imbalance). Such hidden biases and imbalances can lead to data tyranny and a major challenge to a data democracy. In this chapter, two essential statistical elements are resolved: the degree of class imbalance and the complexity of the concept; solving such issues helps in building the foundations of a data democracy. Furthermore, statistical measures which are appropriate in these scenarios are discussed and implemented on a real-life dataset (car insurance claims). In the end, popular data-level methods such as random oversampling, random undersampling, synthetic minority oversampling technique, Tomek link, and others are implemented in Python, and their performance is compared.}

abstract="A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Recent years brought increased interest in applying machine learning techniques to difficult ``real-world'' problems, many of which are characterized by imbalanced data. Additionally the distribution of the testing data may differ from that of the training data, and the true misclassification costs may be unknown at learning time. Predictive accuracy, a popular choice for evaluating performance of a classifier, might not be appropriate when the data is imbalanced and/or the costs of different errors vary markedly. In this Chapter, we discuss some of the sampling techniques used for balancing the datasets, and the performance measures more appropriate for mining imbalanced datasets.",

This algorithm improves the YOLOv4 model and uses the Kmeans++ algorithm to obtain the prior frame in the model to enhance the scale adaptability. Take citrus pictures independently and expand the data, use the LableImage platform to mark the data, and train the network model under the Darknet framework. According to the results, the citrus recognition model has good robustness and real-time performance to the common interference factors and their superposition in natural picking environment. The average recognition accuracy is 89.23 and the average detection speed is 60 ms. The average recognition accuracy is 89.23. It meets the requirements of real-time image recognition speed and accuracy of citrus picking robot.}

abstract = {The importance of the inspection process has been magnified by the requirements of the modern manufacturing environment. In electronics mass-production manufacturing facilities, an attempt is often made to achieve 100% quality assurance of all parts, subassemblies, and finished goods. A variety of approaches for automated visual inspection of printed circuits have been reported over the past two decades. In this survey, algorithms and techniques for the automated inspection of printed circuit boards are examined. A classification tree for these algorithms is presented and the algorithms are grouped according to this classification. This survey concentrates mainly on image analysis and fault detection strategies; these also include state-of-the-art techniques. A summary of the commercial PCB inspection systems is also presented.}

abstract="Neural Networks are used to find a generalised solution from a sample set of a problem domain. When a small sample is all that is available, the correct division of data between the training, testing and validation sets is crucial to the performance of the resultant trained network. Data is often divided uniformly between the three data sets. We propose an alternative method for the optimal division of the data, based on empirical evidence from experiments with artificial data. The method is tested on real world data sets, with encouraging results.",
